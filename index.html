            <p>In sha Allah I will give 8 to 12 hours for this course. I have no job without this course. So I want to learn and practice more. I decide when the module will be released at 10 am I will go to my bed to sleep after I finish watching. Then in the morning I will watch the video again and practice. And other times I will practice and learn from the module subject by Google.</p>

            <p>Hailing from a working class family, I have learned, from the very start, the importance of passion, dedication, confidence and time management. I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning. </p>
